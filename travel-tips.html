    <h2>Entry &amp; Visa</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>Digital Arrival Card:</strong> From 1 May 2025 all
          non‑Thai nationals must submit an online Thailand Digital Arrival
          Card (TDAC) within 72 hours of arrival. It replaces the paper
          TM6 form and requires details of your journey, accommodation and a
          health declaration. You can register multiple travellers (up to 10
          people) in one application.</p>
        <p><strong>Visa Exemptions:</strong> Citizens from many countries
          including the UK and Ireland can stay visa‑free for up to 60 days.
          Travellers from other regions may need to apply for a visa or use
          visa on arrival. Always check official rules before your trip.</p>
        <p><strong>Insurance &amp; Health:</strong> Healthcare in Thailand
          is not free for visitors. Purchase comprehensive travel insurance
          covering medical care and emergency evacuation. Pack any
          prescription medications in original containers and carry insect
          repellent to guard against mosquitoes.</p>

    <h2>Money Matters</h2>
    <div class="two-col">
      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>Currency:</strong> The Thai baht (THB) is the only legal
          currency. Although some vendors quote prices in US dollars, they
          offer unfavourable exchange rates. Bring a mix of cash and cards.
          Cash is essential for markets, street food and rural areas where
          credit cards aren’t accepted. Use ATMs or currency booths to
          withdraw baht.</p>
        <p><strong>Card Use:</strong> When using a card, opt to pay in
          baht to avoid dynamic currency conversion fees. Notify your bank
          before travelling to prevent card blocks, and carry spare cash as
          backup.</p>

    <h2>Etiquette &amp; Respect</h2>
    <div class="two-col">

      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>Dress Modestly:</strong> When visiting temples or royal
          sites, cover shoulders and knees. Remove your shoes before entering
          worship halls and never point your feet at a Buddha statue. Women
          should avoid hugging or touching monks.</p>
        <p><strong>Mindful Behaviour:</strong> Keep voices low and avoid
          public displays of affection. To greet someone, press your palms
          together in a wai and bow your head slightly. Return smiles—
          Thailand is nicknamed the “Land of Smiles” for a reason.</p>
        <p><strong>Do’s &amp; Don’ts:</strong> Don’t step on thresholds
          when entering homes or temples, don’t touch people’s heads, and
          don’t raise your voice in frustration. Vaping and e‑cigarettes are
          illegal, and smoking is banned on many beaches. Respect the
          monarchy: stand for the national anthem when it plays in public
          places such as cinemas.</p>

    <h2>Weather &amp; When to Visit</h2>
    <div class="two-col">
      <div class="text">
        <p>The best time to visit is during the cool, dry season from
          November through early April when temperatures range between
          29–36°C (84–97°F). In these months the south‑west coast has
          calm seas ideal for diving and snorkelling. From May to
          October expect hot, humid weather and short but intense
          downpours; this is low season so crowds thin out and prices drop.</p>

    <h2>Responsible Tourism</h2>
    <p>Support local communities by choosing ethically run tours and
      activities. Avoid riding elephants or posing with captive wildlife.
      Respect nature by disposing of waste properly and conserving water.
      Shop locally and avoid bargaining aggressively – the difference in
      price is small to you but meaningful to vendors.</p>
